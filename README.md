# no-fixups-action

[![CI](https://github.com/matijs/autosquash-blocker-action/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/matijs/autosquash-blocker-action/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This action can be used as a blocking status check on pull requests that contain
commits that should have been auto-squashed.

## Usage

```yaml
- name: Check for 'amend!', 'fixup!', or 'squash!' commits
  uses: matijs/no-fixups-action@v1
```

This action will only run on pull requests and will fail when used on, for
example, pushes. There is one input. There are no outputs.

It is not necessary to use
[actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) first. This action takes
care of that and can be used on its own. See below if you want to do the
checkout yourself.

## If you want to use `actions/checkout` yourself

Make sure to pass the `fetch-depth` and `ref` inputs to the checkout action and
let `no-fixups-action` know it can skip the checkout like this:

```yaml
- name: Checkout
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0
    ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
- name: Check for 'amend!', 'fixup!', or 'squash!' commits
  uses: matijs/no-fixups-action@v1
  with:
    skip-checkout: true
```
